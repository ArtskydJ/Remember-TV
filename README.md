# Remember TV

An electron app to track which episodes you've watched, which are in progress.

I've stopped using this in favor of services like Plex.

## Usage

Open up a directory of video files on your computer, and track which you have watched

## Building

To create files in the `dist` folder, do `npm run bundle && npm run build`

## Developing

To run the program for testing, do `npm run start` and `npm run watch` in two different console windows/tabs.
