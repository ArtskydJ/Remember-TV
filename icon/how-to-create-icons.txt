OVERVIEW

We need:
.png for linux
.icns for macs
.ico for windows


HOW TO

1. Create a 512x512 or 1024x1024 png, and save as icon{whatever}_SOURCE.png

2. To create the mac icon{whatever}.icns file, use:
	- https://cloudconvert.com/png-to-icns
	- OR https://makeappicon.com/


3. In paint.net, downscale to 64x64 using Best Quality sampling. Save the 64x64 png as icon{whatever}.png.

4. In paint.net, downscale the source png to 256x256 using Best Quality as icon{whatever}.ico file. Use a Merged Image with 256, 64, 48, 40, 32, 24, 20, and 16 pixel square images, all 32-bit depth.
OR only export the 256x256?

5. In package.json, change the build script to `--icon=icon/icon{whatever}` (no extension)



OR
Try using the native image API to just load the large PNG, and have it auto-rescale all the needed icons?
