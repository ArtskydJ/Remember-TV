- Complete keyboard navigation
- Add button to modal to close VLC
	- Or use a built-in video player instead of VLC
		- This could be tricky if you want to do things like change audio tracks, etc.
- Show "pro-tips" in the modal
- Color code the xxx/yyy progress text, to show if completed, in progress, or watched
- Don't show empty folders
- Make a timer on the modal, and only mark a video as "watched" if it has been playing for 15 minutes or more
