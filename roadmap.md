# 1.0.0


- Create a build
	- When I make a build, and run the exe, the program crashes. IDK why...

# Future

- Get rid of top menu bar. Or add controls to it? (e.g. mark all in current dir as watched/unwatched, and change dir)
- Add button to modal to close VLC
- Show "pro-tips" in the modal
- Color code the xxx/yyy progress text, to show if completed, in progress, or watched
